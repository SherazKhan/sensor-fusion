Use accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartphones to identify vehicle type (bus or car) and phone location (driver side or passenger side).

  1. Extract gravity signal (see "Extract Gravity Signal" iPython notebook)
  2. Rotate XYZ signals to vehicle reference frame (see "Rotate Sensor Data to
  Vehicle Reference Frame" iPython notebook)
  3. Resample time series data to 10 Hz sampling rate (see "Resample Sensor
  Data to 10 Hz Sampling Rate" iPython notebook)
